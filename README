This is the current api that The University of Melbourne Rover Team uses for their camera system.

It uses LibUsb to handle USB IO for connecting / disconnecting devices, and LibUvc for handling opening and formatting of cameras (see [CameraThread])

It also uses LibVA for hardware accelerated encoding, currently using H264 to reduce latency and overhead of software codec implementations (see [EncoderThread]).

These events are all handled by a centralized manager which handles all events from our client over ROS & WebRTC to handle changes with camera settings (see [ManagerThread]) such as bitrate, frame dimensions, frames per second, etc.

after encoding, all packets are sent over RTP to our media server which handles client side streams.
